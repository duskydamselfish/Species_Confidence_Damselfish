##### Setup #####

#load packages needed
library(emmeans)
library(performance)
library(see)
library(patchwork)
library(ggplot2)
library(rsq)
library(nloptr)

#set working directory
setwd("~/Desktop")

#load in raw data
color_data <- read.csv("Color_and_Damselfish_Data_Sheet_31Jan2022.csv", header=T)
size_data <- read.csv("size_error.csv", header=T)

#remove all SD lower than 141
color_data2 <- color_data[color_data$SD_cm >= 141,]

#remove beaufort 3
data_final <- color_data2[color_data$Beaufort <= 2,]

#remove N/A rows within the data
data_final <- subset(data_final, !is.na(data_final$Trial))

##### Calculating Means and Standard Deviation of Data Set Values #####
mean(data_final$Fish_size_cm)
mean(data_final$Group_size)
mean(data_final$SD_cm)
mean(data_final$Hard_substrate_cover)
sd(data_final$Fish_size_cm)
sd(data_final$Group_size)
sd(data_final$SD_cm)
sd(data_final$Hard_substrate_cover)

##### Calculating error for flusher's fish size estimation #####
# size_data contains the following columns:
# Trial: trial number of each size estimation during training exercise 
# Guess: Estimation of object size in cm
# Actual: Measured object size in cm
# Difference: Difference between estimation and measurement in cm

t.test(size_data$Guess, size_data$Actual, paired = TRUE, conf.level = .95) #t test for error

##### Graphical Analysis #####
#checking data distributions
hist(data_final$FID)
hist(data_final$SD_cm)
hist(data_final$Fish_size_cm)
hist(data_final$Group_size)
boxplot(data_final$FID~data_final$Treatment_color)
boxplot(data_final$RGB_color_difference~data_final$Treatment_color)
boxplot(data_final$HSB_color_difference~data_final$Treatment_color)
hist(data_final$HSB_color_difference)

##### Contingency Table Treatment and Rain - Not Significant #####
table(data_final$Treatment_color, data_final$Rain)
chisq.test(data_final$Treatment_color, data_final$Rain)

##### Contingency Table Treatment and Beaufort - Not Significant #####
table(data_final$Treatment_color, data_final$Beaufort)
chisq.test(data_final$Treatment_color, data_final$Beaufort)

##### Correlation Matrix - checking for collinearity #####
data_cor <- subset(data_final, select = c(SD_cm, Hard_substrate_cover, Depth_cm, Fish_size_cm, Group_size))
data_cor <- subset(data_cor, !is.na(data_cor$Depth_cm)) #Remove NA from data
cor(data_cor)





##### Testing for Species Confidence Hypothesis #####

##### Fitting Linear Models #####
m1 <- lm(FID ~ Treatment_color + SD_cm + Hard_substrate_cover + Depth_cm + Fish_size_cm + Group_size + Beaufort + Treatment_color*SD_cm + Treatment_color*Hard_substrate_cover + Treatment_color*Fish_size_cm + Treatment_color*Group_size, data = data_final)

check_model(m1) #checking assumptions of model
anova(m1) #checks if main effects/interactions are significant
summary(m1) #breakdown of estimates - allow you to make predication equation
rsq.partial(m1) #gives partial R^2 which is the effect size for each predictor in the model

##### Easier to View Partial R-squared #####
library("rsq")
rp <-rsq.partial(m1)
vec1 <- rp$variable
vec2 <- rp$partial.rsq
part_r2 <- data.frame(vec1, vec2)
View(part_r2)
rsq.partial(m1, adj=FALSE, type=c("v"))

##### EMMEANS #####

contrast <- emmeans(m1, "Treatment_color") 
pairs(contrast)

##### EMMEANS Cohen's D #####
pwpm(contrast)
pwpm(contrast, means = FALSE, flip = TRUE, reverse = TRUE,       side = ">", delta = 0.05, adjust = "none")

eff_size(contrast, sigma = sigma(m1), edf = df.residual(m1))

##### Testing EMMEANS #####
testing <- emmeans(m1, ~ "Treatment_color")
pairs(testing)
testing_plot <- plot <- plot(testing, horizontal=F, comparisons=T) + theme_bw()
contrast(testing, interaction = T)

##### Ran EMTRENDS and found nothing significant #####
emtrends(m1, pairwise ~ "Treatment_color", var = "Hard_substrate_cover") #emtrends with hard substrate
